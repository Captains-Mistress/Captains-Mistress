# Captains-Mistress

Team for the final project of the Algorihtms Analysis and Design Course (Monsoon 2020).
Here, we are looking to computationally analyze non-luck-based games and (optimal or sub-optimal) algorihtms to play them.

## Repository Layout
One repository for all the members' logs. One repository each for every game being analyzed, with all the resources related to that game in the corresponding repo.
